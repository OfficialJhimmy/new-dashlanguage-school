            Learning a foreign language such as GermanðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, or
            SpanishðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¦ to an intermediate or Diploma level (B1) is an excellent
            achievement and can open doors to various academic and professional
            opportunities. It's great to hear that Dash Language School offers a
            pathway to gain direct entry to renowned universities for foreign
            language courses without requiring the Joint Admissions and

            For individuals aspiring to pursue a degree course in foreign
            languages at universities like Obafemi Awolowo University(OAU),
            University of Ibadan(UI), University of Nigeria, NSUKKA(UNN), or
            Lagos State University, achieving proficiency in a foreign language
            is a critical step. Being able to bypass the typical JAMB admission
            process can offer a unique and appealing opportunity for students
            who are passionate about foreign language study.

            For students considering this pathway, it's important to understand
            the specific language proficiency and academic requirements for
            direct entry to the second year of a degree course at these
            universities. It's essential to ensure that the language courses and
            qualifications offered by Dash Language School align with the
            admission criteria of the desired universities.

            decide, research, and understand the language degree courses
            available at the universities they intend to apply to. This will
            help to ensure that the chosen university and degree course align

            bypassing the JAMB examination can streamline the admission process,
            there may still be specific academic and language proficiency
            standards that must be met to gain entry to the foreign language
            programs at these universities.
